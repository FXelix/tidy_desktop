This is a script that cleans up your desktop. It moves all images and music in the specific Windows folders.

This script uses regular expressions and searches for images with the extension .png, .jp(e)g, .gif and music with the extensions
.mp3, .avi and .wav and moves the to the specific Windows folder desgined for it. 
They are located in 'C:\Users\USERNAME\Pictures' or 'C:\Users\USERNAME\Music'.

closes after a few seconds.
